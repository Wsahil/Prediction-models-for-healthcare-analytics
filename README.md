# Predictive Modeling for Smoking and Drinking Trends
This project aimed to leverage machine learning techniques to predict smoking and drinking behaviors based on health metrics and personal data. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, the project sought to uncover underlying patterns and trends influencing these lifestyle choices.

## Project Overview

**Dataset**: Smoking and Drinking Dataset with Body Signal (Kaggle), containing 991,346 rows and 24 columns of health metrics and personal information.

 **Technologies Used**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PySpark), Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting)
 **Key Objectives**:
  - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights and guide feature selection.
  - Develop predictive models for smoking and drinking behaviors using machine learning algorithms.
  - Optimize model performance through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
  - Leverage distributed computing with PySpark to handle large datasets efficiently.
